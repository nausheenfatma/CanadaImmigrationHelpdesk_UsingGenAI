Quarterly Financial Report for the quarter ended December 31, 2014



1. Introduction
 
This quarterly report has been prepared by management as required by section 65.1 of the Financial Administration Act and in the form and manner prescribed by Treasury Board. This quarterly report should be read in conjunction with the 2014-15 Main Estimates, the 2013-14 Quarterly Financial Report for the quarter ended December 31, 2013 and Canada's Economic Action Plan 2012 (Budget 2012).
 
A summary description of the Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) programs may be found in Part II of the Main Estimates.  (Refer page: http://publiservice.tbs-sct.gc.ca/ems-sgd/me-bpd/20142015/me-bpdtb-eng.asp)

Basis of Presentation
 
This quarterly report has been prepared by management using an expenditure basis of accounting. The accompanying Statement of Authorities includes the Department’s spending authorities granted by Parliament and those used by the Department consistent with the Main Estimates for the 2014–15 fiscal year and the Supplementary Estimates (B) for fiscal year 2014-2015. This quarterly report has been prepared using a special purpose financial reporting framework designed to meet financial information needs with respect to the use of spending authorities.
 
The authority of Parliament is required before moneys can be spent by the Government. Approvals are given in the form of annually approved limits through appropriation acts or through legislation in the form of statutory spending authority for specific purposes.
 
As part of the Parliamentary business of supply, the Main Estimates must be tabled in Parliament on or before March 1 preceding the new fiscal year. 
 
Citizenship and Immigration Canada prepares its annual departmental financial statements that are part of the departmental performance reporting process, on a full accrual basis in accordance with Treasury Board accounting policies, which are based on Canadian generally accepted accounting principles for the public sector. However, the spending authorities voted by Parliament remain on an expenditure basis.
 
This quarterly report has not been subject to an external audit or review.



2. Highlights of fiscal quarter and fiscal year-to-date (YTD) results
 
This quarterly financial report reflects the results of the current fiscal period in comparison to the authorities provided in the combination of the Main Estimates and Supplementary Estimates (B) for fiscal year 2014–2015, as well as budget adjustments approved by Treasury Board up to December 31, 2014.

Significant Changes to Authorities

Vote 7 – Write-off Outstanding Immigration Loans
 
The Department’s Vote 7 – Write-off of Outstanding Immigration Loans increase by $1 million which represents the amount requested in Supplementary Estimates (B).

Budgetary Statutory Authorities
 
The 2014–15 statutory authorities level in the third quarter is significantly lower than 2013–14 by $339 million and is primarily explained as follows:
 - Passport Canada Program variance ($324 million) between an anticipated deficit ($70 million) for 2013-14 and an anticipated surplus ($254 million) for 2014-15. 
  
Passport Canada Program was integrated into CIC effective July 2, 2013. However due to the timing of the integration, Passport financial components were only included in CIC statements beginning in the third quarter of 2013-14.
The deficit of $70 million anticipated in 2013-14 was established based on revenues with the fee structure in effect before July 1, 2013.The anticipated surplus of $254 million for 2014-15 factors in the introduction of the new fee structure in effect July 1, 2013.
The anticipated $254 million surplus in 2014-15 is the positive balance of revenues over expenses. The Passport Canada Program operates on a cost-recovery basis and finances its activities through the fees charged for its services. Program funds are placed in a revolving fund which has a continuing non-lapsing authority from Parliament under Statutory Authorities. 
This surplus will help to fund the program's deficits during years when revenues do not cover expenditures.

Significant Changes to Departmental Budgetary Expenditures by Standard Object

Quarter over quarter analysis
 
As reflected in the Table of Departmental Budgetary Expenditures by Standard Object, CIC’s net budgetary expenditures for the quarter ending December 31, 2014 were $321 million compared to $300 million as of December 31, 2013, representing an increase of $21 million or 7%. 
 
Total gross budgetary expenditures have increased by $43 million or 10% from $438 million to $481 million. CIC, through the addition of the Passport Program and International Experience Canada (IEC), also added respectively $158 million and $1 million in re-spendable revenues, thereby resulting in a net budgetary expenditure of $321 million.  
 
The integration of Passport Canada into CIC led to the changes in the expenditure structure. With ESDC providing passport service delivery on behalf of CIC, salary for staff transferred to ESDC previously recorded under Personnel are now reported under Professional Services invoiced by ESDC. This mostly explains the shift for the third quarter between the decrease in salary and the increase in expenditures for Professional and Special Services. For this 2014–15 quarter, Passport integration had an impact of $7 million of the $43 million gross expenditure increase. 
 
The other significant change for this quarter relates to the increase in Transfer payments mostly related to the Settlement Program, the Canada-Quebec Accord on Immigration and the Resettlement Assistance Program which accounts for an overall increase of $25 million compared to previous year. 

Cumulative analysis
 
As reflected in the Table of Departmental Budgetary Expenditures by Standard Object, CIC’s year-to-date expenditures as of December 31, 2014 were $1,452 million compared to $1,278 million as of December 31, 2013, representing 69% of the total budgetary authorities available for use for the year ending on March 31, 2015.
 
Total respendable revenues for the same period increased from $285 million to $475 million and are mostly from the integration of Passport Canada Program. This increase in revenue of $190 million applied against the $174 million increase of expenditures explains the reduction of the net budgetary expenditures from $993 million to $977 million. 
 
This increase of $174 million in year to date expenditures is mostly explained by:
 - Integration of Passport Canada Program: ($100 million). Since July 2, 2013 Passport Canada has been a part of CIC. As a result, cumulative data for 2013-14 represents the period from July 2013 to December 2013 (6 months) while 2014-15 data represents the period from April 2014 to December 2014 (9 months). The first three months of 2013-14 is included in DFATD’s statements. This integration has brought significant fluctuations between salary and professional services since salaries for staff transferred to ESDC were recorded last year under salary while in 2014-15 they are reflected under professional services since ESDC invoices CIC for passport delivery services.  
 - Transfer payments: ($42 million). This is explained by an increase of $35 million for the grant related to the Canada-Quebec Accord on Immigration, an increase of $10 million in the Resettlement Assistance Program offset by a decrease of $3 million in the Settlement Program.
 - Other subsidies and payments (excluding Passport Program): ($17 million). This is mostly explained by a reduction in fee refunds for terminated applications with respect to Federal Skilled Workers ($4 million), an increase for CIC’s portion of pay in arrears charges ($12 million) and an increase of the fee returns for terminated applications for the Immigrant Investor Program ($6 million).



3. Risks and Uncertainties
 
 CIC operates in a constantly changing environment. Its strategic directions as well as its policies and operations are influenced by external factors such as emerging events, the Canadian and global economic, social or political contexts and shifting migration trends. CIC’s evolving mandate and integration of new programs and staff inherently contains a level of risk as CIC continuously advances its own internal systems through change initiatives such as the Modernization agenda.

Unforeseen Events and Natural Disasters
 
Unforeseen events and natural disasters may have significant effects on CIC’s operations and reputation. They can affect CIC directly when they occur in places where our offices and employees are located. 
 
Additionally, CIC can also be indirectly affected when the Department is required, for humanitarian or legal reasons, to facilitate travel of foreign nationals or Canadian citizens by processing applications for visas or other necessary documents.  
 
In conjunction with its national and international partners, CIC continues to identify, assess, monitor, and proactively implement measures to mitigate risks and minimize the impact they may have on our operations, commitments, service standards and processing targets. 

Litigation and Legal
 
There is a risk that the pace and scope of change in CIC’s policies (including legislative and regulatory changes) and programs could lead to additional pressure with respect to litigation, which may impact our resources. Over the last few years, there has been a significant increase in the number of complex and high-profile litigation.
 
Sound project management practices are in place to manage all of these changes and ensure timely delivery of CIC’s programs and client services.



4. Significant Changes in Relation to Operations, Personnel and Programs
 
Ms. Catrina Tapley was appointed Assistant Deputy Minister for Strategic and Program Policy at CIC on November 17, 2014.
 
There have been no other significant changes in relation to operations, personnel and programs during the quarter ended December 31, 2014.



5. Budget 2012 Implementation
 
This section provides an overview of savings measures announced in Budget 2012 that are being implemented in order to refocus government and programs; make it easier for Canadians and business to deal with their government; and, modernize and reduce the back office. 
 
CIC will achieve Budget 2012 savings of $71.2 million by 2014–15 through modernization and efficiency measures, by transforming how it works internally, and by consolidating and streamlining its operations.  
 
In the first year of implementation in 2012–13, CIC achieved savings of $26.5 million. Savings have increased to $59 million for 2013–14.  
 
The incremental ongoing savings from 2013–14 to 2014–15 is $12.2 million. This is a result of increased savings of $13.9 million offset by a decrease in savings of $1.7 million and is explained by the following:

Increase in savings of $13.9 million
 
CIC's authorities in the Main Estimates for 2014–15 have been reduced by the following: 

Vote 1 – Operating Expenditures ($8.4 million) and Statutory Employee Benefit Plan Costs ($0.7 million), for a total of $9.1 million
 - $4.5 million – Reducing the number of CIC offices overseas by implementing a more integrated, modernized and centralized working environment;
 - $4.5 million – Reductions in back office costs; and
 - $0.1 million – Reducing the number of regional headquarters.

Vote 5 – Grants and Contributions $4.8 million
 - $3.3 million – Changing the ratio of government-assisted refugees (GAR) to privately sponsored refugees; and 
 - $1.5 million – Elimination of federal contributions to Provinces and Territories relating to maintenance of Immigration Portals. 

Decrease in savings of $1.6 million
 
The savings related to the reform of the Interim Federal Health Program (IFHP) have been adjusted from $24.5 million in 2013–14 to $22.9 million in 2014–15 based on actual up-take. 
 
The impact of Budget 2012 has been mitigated through the ongoing modernization of CIC’s processing network. This modernization is being achieved through various measures including the deployment of the Global Case Management System to all overseas and in-Canada offices, the ongoing implementation of e-applications, a growing visa application centre network, the centralization of some overseas processing in Canada and improved online information and tools.
 
Service levels at CIC are primarily measured through service standards and processing times, which CIC posts and regularly updates on its Web site.
