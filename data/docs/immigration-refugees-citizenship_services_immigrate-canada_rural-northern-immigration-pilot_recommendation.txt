We’ll continue to process applications we received on or before this date.
 
If you’re eligible, you can still apply for a work permit so you can work while we process your application. (Refer page: /en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/rural-northern-immigration-pilot/optional-tr.html)
 
Each community has its own recommendation process.
 
When applying to a community for recommendation, you’ll be asked to provide supporting documents.
