Types of rentals
 
There are different types of housing for rent in Canada. Common rental examples
 - an apartment (in a building with many units)
 - a house
 - a room in someone’s house or condominium



Responsibilities of landlords and tenants
 
Your landlord is the person who owns the house or building you live in. A landlord can also hire a property manager or superintendent to collect rent and manage the rental for them.
 
Both renters and landlords have legal rights and responsibilities when they sign a rental agreement. Each province and territory has its own residential tenancy act that explains what landlords and tenants must do.

Protect yourself from abuse
 
It is illegal for anyone to pressure you into doing  things you don’t want to do in exchange for rent.
 
Contact a newcomer services provider for help with your rental situation. (Refer page: https://ircc.canada.ca/english/newcomers/services/index.asp)
 
Call 911 or your local police if you feel unsafe.
 
In general, your landlord
 - collects the rent
 - keeps the property safe and in good condition
 - provides items or services that may be included in the rental agreement, including
    
appliances, like a stove or refrigerator
utilities, like electricity or heating

In  most provinces and territories, your landlord must give you at  least 24 hours of written notice before entering the rental unit, unless  there are exceptional circumstances.
 
If you don’t have a job, references or a credit history in Canada, you can ask a newcomer services provider what you should do to get started.

Before you visit a rental unit, make a list of questions you may want to ask the landlord or superintendent.



Visiting rental units
 
When visiting a rental unit, take the time to ask questions about the unit and check that everything works.
 - Turn on the faucets to check water pressure and temperature, and turn on the appliances if they are included in the rental agreement.
 - Ask if the utilities (like heat, water, electricity and Internet) are included in the rental price. If not, you must make sure the utilities get connected and pay for them.
 - Find out if the neighbourhood is safe by researching online or by visiting the neighbourhood in person.



Moving in and signing a lease
 
When you agree to rent a place, you and your landlord should sign a lease (also called a rental agreement). A lease is a legal document that describes what you and your landlord have agreed to for the rental period. It includes the rental cost, payment due dates, rental period, and maintenance responsibilities. 
  In some provinces, when you sign the lease, a landlord may ask for
 - rent for the first and last months of the rental period
 - a security deposit
 
In these cases, if you stop paying rent or damage the property, your landlord will use the deposit to cover these costs. They may also request more money if your security deposit is not enough to cover the damages.
 
Before you sign a lease, make sure that you understand it. You may want to ask a friend, relative or newcomer services provider to help you. If you have complicated or serious concerns, you may want to ask a lawyer for a consultation. There may be a fee. (Refer page: https://www.cba.org/For-The-Public/Find-A-Lawyer)
 
You usually have to pay the rent to your landlord, superintendent or property manager on the first day of every month. Pay your rent according to the terms specified in your lease. Your lease usually includes the option to pay
 - in cash
 - by e-transfer
 - by post-dated cheque
    
Many landlords ask for 12 cheques dated the first day of each month for the next 12 months.

Before you move in, ask your landlord or the superintendent to explain the rules for
 - doing laundry
 - getting your mail
 - taking out garbage and recycling
 - using the appliances
 - tenant and visitor parking
 - using the intercom (in an apartment or a condo building)



Rent increases
 
Each province and territory has its own rules for rent increases. In most parts of Canada, your landlord must give you a 90-day written notice before they increase your rent. 
  Some provinces and territories limit the amount a landlord can increase rent prices each year. Make sure you know your rights as a renter.



Moving out
 
One to three months before moving out, you must tell your landlord in writing that you will be leaving. The amount of time you give depends on the province or territory you live in.
 
If you’re renting, you may not be able to end your lease early. If you need to end it early, arrange it with your landlord. Depending on the law in your province or territory, you may have to pay a fee. You may also be able to sublet your unit until the lease ends.
